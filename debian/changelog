  * FHS.
  * Changed GPL location in copyright files
  * Include source, as previous upload was accidently made without a diff

 -- Edward Betts <edward@debian.org>  Sat,  6 Nov 1999 01:27:42 +0000

vnc (3.3.2r2-4) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/vncserver.debian: Do not remove too many font pathes, that means,
    check for :unscaled and font server.
  * debian/control: Depend on xbase-clients, not xbase. closes: #33028, #32821.
    The latter is an important bug and holding up the release of slink.

vnc (3.3.2r2-3) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Bugfixes only. The memory leak (see below) make it worth to include it
    in frozen.
  * control (vncserver): Added dependency on xbase because xauth is used in
    vncserver script (David Karlin) and fixed a small typo (lintian).
  * Xvnc/programs/Xserver/hw/vnc/rfbserver.c: Fixed memory leak (#27624).
  * Xvnc/config/cf/Imake.cf: Added Arm, Sparc, PowerPC architecture.
    Xvnc/config/cf/linux.cf: Likewise.
    (Tor Slettnes <tor@slett.net>, #29831 for Alpha and
     Christian Meder <meder@isr.uni-stuttgart.de>, #30407 for Sparc,
     Daniel Jacobowitz <drow@them.org>, #29833).
  * Xvnc/programs/Xserver/cfb/stipsprc32.s: Additional Sparc changes (see above).
    Xvnc/programs/Xserver/cfb/stipsparc.s: Likewise.
  * debian/vncserver.debian: Remove invalid font pathes.
    (Bruce A. Mah <bmah@CA.Sandia.GOV>, #21635)
  * debian/vncserver.debian: Add '--help' and '-h' as alias for '-help'. (#26872)

vnc (3.3.2r2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * svncviewer.postinst: Changed suid-register 4775 to 4755. Fixes: #27228.

 -- Marcus Brinkmann <brinkmd@debian.org>  Tue, 29 Sep 1998 22:13:12 +0200

vnc (3.3.2r2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. Fixes: #26673.
  * Fixed vncserver script one more time. Fixes: #25471, #26080, #26836.
  * Added '-clean' option to vncserver and vncserver(1x)
    (by Dirk Eddelbuettel). Fixes: #26871.
  * Added Replaces: and Conflicts: vnc-doc to vncserver and xvnviewer.
    Reason: vnc-doc is obsolete and should be removed from Debian (already
    reported as a bug against ftp.debian.org). The documentation is out of
    date and new documentation is included in the packages themselve.

 -- Marcus Brinkmann <brinkmd@debian.org>  Thu, 24 Sep 1998 04:32:49 +0200

vnc (3.3.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version, based on X11R6.3 source code:
    + Now native support for gzip'd fonts.
    + Fixed Keyboard handling (hopefully).
  * Added (slightly modified) FAQ from the web site.

 -- Marcus Brinkmann <brinkmd@debian.org>  Fri, 12 Jun 1998 22:54:15 +0200

vnc (3.3.1-5) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Now the cool configuration files will actually be parsed. Sorry for
    this. Fixes: #21062.

 -- Marcus Brinkmann <Marcus.Brinkmann@ruhr-uni-bochum.de>  Mon, 13 Apr 1998 19:51:18 +0200

vnc (3.3.1-4) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * This should be in frozen. It fixes many bugs and violations of policy.
    Indeed it is the first usable release of vnc.
  * Added patch by Mark Spencer <markster@marko.net> to
    support gzip'd fonts. xfs cludge no longer necessary.
  * Removed rpath-link from upstream config file.
  * Changed vncserver to parse config files in /etc/vnc.conf and ~/.vncrc.
  * Changed vncpasswd to parse config files and get the default passwd file
    location from there. Also made it verbose if file could not be written.
  * Wrote six man pages. Please read them, I spent a lot of time on them.
  * Changed rule files to make three packages, one server and two clients.
      vncserver is now the X server.
      xvncviewer is now the client for X.
      svncviewer is now the client for svgalib.

vnc (3.3.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Move /usr/vnc to /usr/lib/vnc.
  * Suggest vnc-doc.
  * Clean up crud from experimental phase.

 -- Christoph Lameter <clameter@debian.org>  Tue, 24 Feb 1998 16:05:10 -0800

vnc (3.3.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Include description from slashdot on how to circumvent the font
    compression problem using xfs. Move to unstable.

 -- Christoph Lameter <clameter@debian.org>  Tue, 24 Feb 1998 07:00:14 -0800

vnc (3.3.1-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Broken font handling. Both the binary from the upstream site and the
    build sourcecode fail when setting the fontpath in the X server.
    Thus experimental. Poked around but found no clue. If someone else
    has time. HELP!
